# Day 26 - 28 - BetterRest

### Challenge
- [x] Replace each VStack in our form with a Section, where the text view is the title of the section. Do you prefer this layout or the VStack layout? It’s your app – you choose!
- [x] Replace the “Number of cups” stepper with a Picker showing the same range of values.
- [x] Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the “Calculate” button entirely.
